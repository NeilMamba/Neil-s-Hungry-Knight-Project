# Neil-s-Hungry-Knight-Project
The Hungry Knight
This python coding file was originally an assignment administered in my fundamentals of computing class. The instructions of the assignment were to create a program that would put in to practice a lot of the foundational introductory lessons we were being introduced to. The output of the program once ran would look like that of an interaction between a customer and a restaurant. The program would require the user to order dishes, which would have totals, and tax calculations implemented to produce the final cost of the order.
The instructions started off by requesting a comment header, which would entail a multi-line comment detailing my name, class name and section, as it shows in my file. It then instructs us to print a welcome message out on to the screen to welcome the user to my application. This was done by printing the string which in my assignment read “Welcome fellow lad’s and lasses to the Hungry Knight Inn!”. It then directs me to enter strings which will read request to the user to enter their name, and characteristic. These would be displayed followed by the term Sir, which will be entered first in a string. The name and characteristic also required variables which I simply kept as “name”, and “characteristic”, which was set up to display whatever the user was to input. 
The program then required me to assign variables to all the food that was on the menu at the Inn. The menu included Roast Pheasant, Beef Stew, loafs of fine bread, and pieces of fine fruit. I was then required to assign them as variables attached to the “int” function which would allow them to be used as integers and not strings. After assigning the amounts to the food I would then work on the code that would be used to prompt the user to enter the amount or quantity of food that they required. These foods would be the appropriately named variables. 
Some math code would be necessary as well to perform the tasks of taxes. This would allow me to calculate and print out the to the console screen the leveraged taxes, which were 5% of the total price for the meals. This amount would later be added to the total amount on the bill. So, I would need to calculate and print out the final total price, that would be charged to the user, and then display the message on to the screen. Minor formatting variations was expected but the priority of the assignment was for it to be functional and legible, as it was the first assignment of the fundamentals of computing python class. The assignment also required me to actively and intentionally include a lot of comments within the code to improve the readability of the program, and to display good coding practices. 
The program would end by displaying the subtotal of all the food ordered by the user, followed by the final cost. The final cost is simply the subtotal with the addition of the taxes that were to be added.
